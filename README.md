## Project Description

This project implements a RESTful API for managing user points per payer using Python and the Flask web framework. Users can add points, spend points, and fetch their current point balance broken down by payer. The API follows specific rules for spending points, such as spending the oldest points first and ensuring no payer's points go negative.
